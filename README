# WARNING: You may have noticed that this code calls a cryptographic hash 
# function. That does NOT mean this code is secure. treeprng is NOT a 
# cryptographic pseudorandom number generator. Do NOT use it in a crypto 
# or security-sensitive application.

CURRENT STATUS:
    2014-01-23: Merged no_mersenne back to master (fast-forward).
                Made master the current branch on github.
    2014-01-22: The code in the new no_mersenne branch seems to work.
                The documentation in the wiki is pretty good.

treeprng is "in alpha", meaning I would like feedback about the
approach, the API, the implementation, and the documentation.
