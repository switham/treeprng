    NEW BRANCH CURRENT STATE: The Wiki has been updated to include 
    a pretty good guide to how this version will work:

        https://github.com/switham/treeprng/wiki

    The code needs to catch up, and the docstrings need to be
    corrected and simplified now.

    BEING UPDATED: This is the beginning of the no_mersenne branch.
    I've already set no_mersenne to the default branch,
    but I'm in the process of making the first code changes
    since the branch point.

    The standard Python prng is based on the Mersenne Twister,
    but it turns out the Python version seeds it using a SHA-512
    hash, which is even more work than the SHA-1 (160 bits) that
    I'm using as default here.  Also, my intended use pattern is
    lots of "seeds" and not builtin stateful sequences.  So the plan
    is to cut out the middleman.

    There is a mersenne branch with stable code based on the Mersenne
    Twister, if you'd like to try that.  Be aware if you do that it 
    generates different numbers than this branch will, for given paths, 
    and that the API is changing slightly.

treeprng is "in alpha", meaning I would like feedback about the
whole approach, the specific implementation, and the documentation.
